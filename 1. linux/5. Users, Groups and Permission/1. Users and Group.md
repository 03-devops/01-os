## Users and Groups

- Are used to `control access to files and resources`
- Every file on the system is `owned by a user` and `associated with a group`

- Every user of system is `assigned a unique user ID number (uid)`
- Users name and UID are `stored in /etc/passwd`
- User's `passwords is stored in /etc/shadow` in encrypted form

## Types of Users

```

```bash
    usermod -aG devops ansible // add user ansible to group devops
    grep devops /etc/group // result: devops:x:1004:ansible
```
