## Pipe

- A pipe (|) is used to `send the output of one command` as `input to anotherâ€”essentially connecting commands` together into a chain
- Examples

```bash
    ls -l | grep ".txt"         // Lists files, then filters only the .txt files
    cat names.txt | sort | uniq // Sorts the names and removes duplicates
```
